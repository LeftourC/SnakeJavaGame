# Custom Assets for Snake Game

Put PNG files (32×32) in this folder to replace the generated graphics:

- `food.png` - Food/apple sprite
- `snake_body.png` - Snake body segment (coming soon)
- `snake_head_up.png`, etc. (coming soon)
- `grid_cell.png` (coming soon)

The game loads these automatically when present. Rebuild the project (mvn compile) after adding new assets.
